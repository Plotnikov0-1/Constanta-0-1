# The Plotnikov Constant Ξ

**Ξ := ∇Φ(0↔1)**

A universal gradient linking potential (0) and manifestation (1), derived from the paradox 0 = 1.

## Overview

This repository contains the formal definition, analytical structure, and philosophical foundation of the constant Ξ.

## Concept Summary

Ξ is not a fixed constant like G or Λ.  
It is a logical operator, a gradient across being, required to explain:

- Why potential becomes form
- Why gravity curves space
- Why information is distinct
- Why paradox sustains systems
